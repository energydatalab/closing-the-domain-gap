# Selecting turbine coordinates

The data collection process took multiple rounds -- we used turbine coordinates from USWTDB and collected aerial images NAIP data using Google Earth Engine's api. As an example of why we needed multiple rounds, say we wanted 100 train and 100 test images from a domain. We would 1) use DBSCAN to cluster the turbine coordinates from a domain and 2) use stratified random sampling to select splits of 100 train and test coordinates. However, when we went to collect those 200 coordinates we might only find 80 of the actual train and 90 of the test locations contained turbines (as NAIP imagery comes from a long timespan). Thus we would recluster the remaining non-sampled coordinates and re-sample to try to get 10 train and 20 test more, etc. Additionally, because coordinates were pulled from the same cluster, sometimes we would have to throw out train images to make sure they didn't overlap in terms of the image content with the test set. Hence we ended up with the reclustering stages shown here.
